# 🔐 Password Security Evaluation Project

## 📘 Overview

This project aims to explore and understand the importance of password complexity in cybersecurity. Through hands-on evaluation, we create passwords of varying complexity, test them using strength checkers, and summarize best practices to strengthen password hygiene.

---

## 📌 Goals

- Create passwords with varied complexity.
- Analyze each password using online strength checkers.
- Understand how length, symbols, and unpredictability impact security.
- Document feedback, attack types, and practical tips.
- Promote awareness of common password vulnerabilities.

---

## 🛠️ Steps Followed

### 1. **Password Creation**
A set of passwords were created with different patterns, character sets, and lengths:

Examples:
- `123456` – Simple numeric
- `password` – Common word
- `Pass1234` – Mixed case with numbers
- `P@ss1234` – Mixed with symbol
- `Y@3!v9Zx` – Random complex
- `IluvMyD*g2024!` – Personalized and strong

---

### 2. **Password Strength Testing**

Used these tool:
- [Security.org Strength Meter](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/)

Each password was tested for:
- Time to crack
- Strength score
- Feedback from the checker

### 3. **Observations & Feedback**

| Password            | Strength     | Estimated Crack Time | Feedback Summary                        |
|---------------------|--------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `123456`            | Very Weak    | < 1 second             | Too common and predictable               |
| `password`          | Very Weak    | < 1 second             | Dictionary word                          |
| `Pass1234`          | Medium       | Minutes                | Needs symbols and more length            |
| `P@ss1234`          | Strong       | Hours                  | Still predictable pattern                |
| `Y@3!v9Zx`          | Strong       | Years                  | Great mix of characters                  |
| `IluvMyD*g2024!`    | Very Strong  | Decades                | Unique and complex phrase-based password |

---

### 4. **Best Practices Learned**

- Use **12+ characters** for stronger resistance.
- Combine **uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols**.
- Avoid using **common words**, **keyboard patterns**, or **personal info**.
- Prefer **random or passphrase-style passwords** (e.g., `Blue!Toaster77!Sun`).
- **Don't reuse passwords** across accounts.
- Use a **password manager** to generate/store strong credentials.
- Enable **2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)** where available.

### 5. **Common Password Attack Types**

| Attack Type         | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Brute Force**     | Tries every combination; longer and complex passwords resist longer.        |
| **Dictionary Attack** | Uses common words and combinations to guess passwords.                     |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Uses leaked password databases on multiple sites.                        |
| **Phishing**        | Tricks users into revealing credentials through fake pages or links.        |
| **Keylogging**      | Malware captures keystrokes to steal passwords in real-time.                |

---

### 6. **Key Takeaway**

> Password strength is not just about complexity, but also **unpredictability** and **length**. Strong password hygiene protects against both automated attacks and targeted breaches.

---

## 📖 Final Outcome

By completing this evaluation, we’ve:
- Learned how to assess password strength
- Identified patterns that make passwords weak or strong
- Understood how attackers exploit poor password practices
- Collected best practices for personal and organizational password security
